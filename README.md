# PS_Game

This is a Repository which has the driver code of the Coin Tossing Algorithm.

There are two codes here, namely 'cointoss.py' and 'cointoss_probability.py'

The Driver Code for the Game is cointoss.py, which decides an outcome of the Coin Toss (Head or Tail) using the 'Random' package/library of Python. We take Guess of the 
Outcome as Input from the User and if their Guess matches the Outcome generated by the Python Script, they proceed to the next round, where they have to select the Ball 
of Specific Color from a Box.

The Other Code, 'cointoss_probability.py' is to check the geniuneness of the written Python Code, where the User will enter the number of repetetions and the probabilities
of Head and Tail will be displayed in terms of Percentage.
